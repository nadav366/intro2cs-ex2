I talked about the exercise with Itay Tayar and Yair Shemer

A program that convert spoon to cup.
A program that doing account operations.
A program that receives three numbers and returns the largest and smallest.
A program that receives and interprets a second-order equation.
A program that calculates the area of several shapes.
A program that checks whether it's summer.
A program that test function 4.

To test function 4 I inserted as many end cases as possible,
such as identical numbers, incomplete, negative, or numbers in a different order.
